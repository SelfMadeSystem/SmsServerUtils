# Built in variables:
# msg - The message being sent to or received from the player
# no-color-msg - Same as msg but with text modifiers stripped.
# name - The player's name.
#
# Additionally, you can use %papi-placeholders% for PlaceholderAPI
# placeholders, obviously replacing the `papi-placeholders` part with
# the actual placeholder. For example: %player-name%
#
# For full use on the evaluator system, please check the docs at:
# <link here>

example: # Average Hawk flag message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
  check: '(no-color-msg startsWith "HAWK:") #use no-color-msg because msg would start with  §cHAWK:# &&
  (msg contains "VL:") && !(msg contains name)
  #We want that ! to invert it because we want to cancel it if its not their flag#'
  cancel: true # Cancel it; not their flag.
  replacement: ''

example2: # Average Hawk notif message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
  check: '(no-color-msg startsWith "hawk:") #use no-color-msg because msg would start with  §cHAWK:# &&
  (msg contains "VL:") && (msg contains name)
  #We want to replace it this time with something else if it is their flag#'
  cancel: false # Don't cancel; it is their flag.
  replacement: 'name s+ " failed: " s+ (no-color-msg substr ((no-color-msg indexOf " failed ") + 8)
  (no-color-msg indexOf ".")) s+ " with VL: "
  s+ (no-color-msg substrr ((no-color-msg indexOf "VL:") + 4))'
