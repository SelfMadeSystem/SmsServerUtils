# Built in variables:
# msg - The message being sent to or received from the player
# name - The player's name.
#
# Additionally, you can use %papi-placeholders% for PlaceholderAPI
# placeholders, obviously replacing the `papi-placeholders` part with
# the actual placeholder. For example: %player-name%
#
# For full use on the evaluator system, please check the docs at:
# <link here>

outgoing-chat:
  example: # Average Hawk flag message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
    check: '(msg startsWith "HAWK:") && (msg contains "VL:") && !(msg contains name)'
    #We want that ! to invert it because we want to cancel it if its not their flag
    cancel: true # Cancel it; not their flag.
    # execute-commands: []

  example2: # Average Hawk notif message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
    check: '(msg startsWith "HAWK:") && (msg contains "VL:") && !(msg contains name)'
    #We want that ! to invert it because we want to cancel it if its not their flag
    cancel: false # Don't cancel; it is their flag.
    replacement: '"&cOwO:&7 " s+ name s+ " failed: " s+ (msg substr ((msg indexOf " failed ") + 8)
    (msg indexOf ".")) s+ " with VL: "
    s+ (msg substrr ((msg indexOf "VL:") + 4)) s+ "&a %player_x% %player_y% %player_z%"'
    is-json: false # Not json.
    # execute-commands: []

# Additional variables for incoming-chat and incoming-tab:
# label - The label of the command (with the `/` included)
#
# It's also going through a preprocessor that does an arg placeholder replacement.
# For ex: Let's say the chat is  /w Brandon Hello. How are you?
#
# %0% is replaced with     Brandon
# %1% is replaced with     Hello.
# %0-1% is replaced with   Brandon Hello.
# %1+% is replaced with    Hello. How are you?
# %6% is replaced with nothing since there's nothing at that arg
# %3-7% is replaced with   are you?
# %2+% is replaced with    How are you?
#
# These are replaced both in strings and as variables.
incoming-chat:
  example:
    check: '(label equalsIc "/pl") or (msg startsWith "/ver ") or (msg startsWith "/version ")'
    cancel: true
    # No evaluator, but still going through PAPI and the preprocessor. (papi first tho)
    send-msg: '%prefix% &cDon''t get our plugins; thx. Command: %msg% Label: %label%'
    # execute-commands: []

# Same rules as incoming-chat apply here.
incoming-command:
  example2:
    check: '!(label startsWith "/")'
    cancel: false
    # PAPI and coloring are not done after the executor is finished.
    replacement: 'msg replace name (color ("&6&l" s+ name s+ "&r"))'
    # execute-commands: []

# For the arg
incoming-tab:
  example:
    checl: '(label equalsIc "/") or (label equalsIc "/ver") or (label equalsIc "/version")'
    cancel: false
    # List of stuff. PAPI and colored
    replacement:
      - 'lol'
      - 'no'
